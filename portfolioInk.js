I have a little storefront over here, though not everything is available there. If there's something you're interested in that isn't listed on the store already, shoot me an email at gryphonillustrations@gmail.com and I might be able to hook you up! I also take commissions if you are interested!","\n",{"->":".^.^.^"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["^ ","ev","str","^none","/str","/ev",{"->":"options"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"global decl":["ev",0,{"VAR=":"lookedat"},"/ev","end",null],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}};
